       full-stack developer who specializes in WordPress and WooCommerce, 
       with development skills combining the prowess of a PHP back-end developer with the creative 
       flair of a JavaScript front-end developer.</p>
       <p>I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. 
       Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from touring and

       to small business owner and entrepreneur — I've never stopped engaging my passion to 
       help others and solve problems.
